This folder contains the files for the version of the Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2012) model with price level targetting.
The main MOD file to run is "NKAccuracy.mod".
The other MOD files are from the Dynare transformation engine available from here: https://github.com/tholden/DynareTransformationEngine
(The Dynare transformation engine assists in defining model local variables reducing model creation speed, and ensuring that all endogenous variables are meaningful over the whole real line.)

Note that complete indexation is "hacked in" to the model without indexation by setting PI_STEADY=1 and then defining TRUE_PI = TRUE_PI_STEADY * PI.
So, in the generated simulations, the value of "PI" is actually the value of true inflation divided by TRUE_PI_STEADY.

Simulations for the paper were created by opening MATLAB, then running:

dynareOBC NKAccuracy.mod SIMULATION_OPTIONS MLVSimulationMode=2 MLVSimulationSubSample=4 cubaturetolerance=0 compilesimulationcode sparse;

where SIMULATION_OPTIONS are the simulation options of the run in question.
