This folder contains the files for the various versions of the Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2012) model considered in the paper.
The main MOD files to run are "NK.mod", "NKPL.mod" and "NKIndexationAccuracy.mod".
The other MOD files are from the Dynare transformation engine available from here: https://github.com/tholden/DynareTransformationEngine
(The Dynare transformation engine assists in defining model local variables reducing model creation speed, and ensuring that all endogenous variables are meaningful over the whole real line.)

To test the properties of these models, run:

dynareOBC NK.mod timetoescapebounds=200 FeasibilityTestGridSize=10 timetosolveparametrically=0
dynareOBC NKPriceTargeting.mod timetoescapebounds=200 FeasibilityTestGridSize=10 timetosolveparametrically=0 

To run the accuracy tests run:

dynareOBC NKIndexationAccuracy.mod SIMULATION_OPTIONS MLVSimulationMode=2 MLVSimulationSubSample=4 cubaturetolerance=0 compilesimulationcode sparse timetosolveparametrically=8 SimulateOnGridPoints;

where SIMULATION_OPTIONS are the simulation options of the run in question.

Note that "NKIndexationAccuracy.mod" hacks indexation in to the model without indexation by setting PI_STEADY=1 and then defining TRUE_PI = TRUE_PI_STEADY * PI.
So, in the generated simulations from this file, the value of "PI" is actually the value of true inflation divided by TRUE_PI_STEADY.
